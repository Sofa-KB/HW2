            <p class="col-sm-10">Brandon was born and raised in Winter Park, FL, and currently works at UPS sorting
                packages. He is married with a 2 year old daughter who is the love of his life.
                Brandon has always enjoyed the ability to be able to create and have his ideas be reflected in
                something that will last.

                <br>

                Brandon is learning coding through UCF Coding Bootcamp in an effort to change his
                career into something he enjoys doing. He looks forward to learning as much as he can through said
                course so that I can better myself in the future.
